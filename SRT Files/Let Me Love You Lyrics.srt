00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:13,220
(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) I used to believe we were burning on

2
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,580
the edge of something beautiful, something beautiful.

3
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:23,540
Selling a dream, smoking mirrors keep us waiting

4
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,020
on a miracle, on a miracle.

5
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,100
So don't do the darkest of days, heaven's

6
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,520
a heartbreak away, never let you go, never

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,040
let me down.

8
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,900
Oh, it's been a hell of a ride,

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,880
driving the edge of a knife, never let

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,460
you go, never let me down.

11
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,140
Don't you give up, nah, nah, nah, I

12
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,100
won't give up, nah, nah, nah.

13
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,580
Let me love you, let me love you.

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,720
Don't you give up, nah, nah, nah, I

15
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,680
won't give up, nah, nah, nah.

16
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,020
Let me love you, let me love you.

17
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:30,060
Don't fall asleep, I thought we were down

18
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,000
a million miles ahead of us, miles ahead

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,680
of us.

20
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:39,880
All that we need is a brute awakening,

21
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,420
you know we're good enough, you know we're

22
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,160
good enough.

23
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,900
So don't do the darkest of days, heaven's

24
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,320
a heartbreak away, never let you go, never

25
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,820
let me down.

26
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,620
Oh, it's been a hell of a ride,

27
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,680
driving the edge of a knife, never let

28
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,480
you go, never let me down.

29
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,940
Don't you give up, nah, nah, nah, I

30
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,900
won't give up, nah, nah, nah.

31
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,100
Let me love you, let me love you.

32
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,520
Don't you give up, nah, nah, nah, I

33
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,500
won't give up, nah, nah, nah.

34
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,820
Let me love you, let me love you.

35
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,520
Don't you give up, nah, nah, nah, I

36
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,500
won't give up, nah, nah, nah.

37
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,080
Don't you give up, nah, nah, nah, I

38
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,180
won't give up, nah, nah, nah.

39
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,840
Let me love you, let me love you.

40
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,120
Don't you give up, nah, nah, nah, I

41
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,120
won't give up, nah, nah, nah.

42
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,340
Let me love you, let me love you.
