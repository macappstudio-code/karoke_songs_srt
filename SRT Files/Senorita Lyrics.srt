(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) I love it when you call me señorita,

2
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,210
I wish I could pretend I didn't need

3
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:23,450
ya.

4
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,310
But every touch is ooh la la la,

5
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,310
it's true la la la.

6
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,910
Ooh, I should be runnin', ooh, you keep

7
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,390
me comin' for ya.

8
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,710
That in Miami, the air was hot from

9
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,150
summer rain sweat drippin' off me.

10
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,250
Before I even knew her name, la la

11
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:42,730
la.

12
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,690
You felt like ooh la la la, yeah,

13
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:48,630
no.

14
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:53,650
Sapphire moonlight, we danced for hours in the

15
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,450
scent of tequila sunrise.

16
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,550
Her body felt right in my hands like

17
00:00:58,550 --> 00:00:59,090
la la.

18
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,129
You felt like ooh la la la, yeah.

19
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,390
I love it when you call me señorita,

20
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:12,350
I wish I could pretend I didn't need

21
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:12,650
ya.

22
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,550
But every touch is ooh la la la,

23
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,670
it's true la la la.

24
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,070
Ooh, I should be runnin', ooh, you know.

25
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:24,770
I love it when you call me señorita,

26
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:28,370
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to

27
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:29,110
leave ya.

28
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,970
But every touch is ooh la la la,

29
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,210
it's true la la la.

30
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,530
Ooh, I should be runnin', ooh, you keep

31
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,050
me comin' for ya.

32
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:42,210
Back in the hotel, there's just some things

33
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,190
that never change.

34
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,970
You say we're just friends, but friends don't

35
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,430
know the way it tastes.

36
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,430
La la la.

37
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,110
Girl, you know it's been a long time

38
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,690
comin', don't you let me fall.

39
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:57,990
Open your lips and just be hooked on

40
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,810
your tongue.

41
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,190
All of your kisses, they don't stop.

42
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,810
I love it when you call me señorita,

43
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,789
I wish I could pretend I didn't need

44
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:10,070
ya.

45
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,990
But every touch is ooh la la la,

46
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,110
it's true la la la.

47
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,570
Ooh, I should be runnin', ooh, you know.

48
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:22,210
I love it when you call me señorita,

49
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,790
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to

50
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:26,590
leave ya.

51
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,390
But every touch is ooh la la la,

52
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,610
it's true la la la.

53
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,970
Ooh, I should be runnin', ooh, you keep

54
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,610
me comin' for ya.

55
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,650
All along I've been comin' for ya.

56
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,790
All along I've been hopin' that something's real.

57
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,490
You call my name, I'll be comin' for

58
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:48,930

59
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,050
Comin' for ya.

00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,750
For ya.

62
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,930
For ya.

63
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,770
Ooh, I should be runnin', ooh, you keep

64
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,350

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,210
For ya.
