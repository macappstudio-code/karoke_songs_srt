00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,080
(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) The club isn't the best place to find

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,900
a lover, so the bar is where I

3
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:14,320
go.

4
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:16,800
Me and my friends sat at the table

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,800
doing shots, drinking fast and then we talked

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,140
slow.

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,280
And you come over and start up a

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,520
conversation with just me, and trust me I'll

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,600
give it a chance.

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,760
Now take my hand, stop, and the man

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,900
on the jukebox, and then we start to

12
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:29,220
dance.

13
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,500
And I'm singing like, girl you know I

14
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,300
want your love, your love was handmade for

15
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,640
somebody like me.

16
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,260
Come on now, follow my lead, I may

17
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,960
be crazy, don't mind me.

18
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,060
Say boy, let's not talk too much, grab

19
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,300
on my waist and put that body on

20
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:45,560
me.

21
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,040
Come on now, follow my lead, come, come

22
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,320
on now, follow my lead.

23
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,200
I'm in love with the shape of you,

24
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,540
we push and pull like a magnet do.

25
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,100
Although my heart is falling too, I'm in

26
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,340
love with your body.

27
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,780
Last night you were in my room, and

28
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,600
now my bed sheets smell like you.

29
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:09,380
Everyday discovering something brand new, I'm in love

30
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,280
with your body.

31
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:29,380
Everyday discovering something brand new, I'm in love

32
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,340
with the shape of you.

33
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,800
And we came and we let the story

34
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,240
begin, we're going out on our first date.

35
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,740
You and me, you're thrifty so go all

36
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,340
you can eat, fill up your bag and

37
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,160
I fill up the plate.

38
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,580
We talk for hours and hours about the

39
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,440
sweet and the sour, and how your family's

40
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,100
doing okay.

41
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,040
And we've been getting a taxi, kissing the

42
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,760
back seat, tell the driver make the radio

43
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,120
play.

44
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,500
And I'm singing like, girl you know I

45
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,280
want your love, your love was handmade for

46
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,660
somebody like me.

47
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,240
Come on now, follow my lead, I may

48
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,960
be crazy, don't mind me.

49
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,040
Say boy, let's not talk too much, grab

50
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,320
on my waist and put that body on

51
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:05,560
me.

52
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,039
Come on now, follow my lead, come, come

53
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,340
on now, follow my lead.

54
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,180
I'm in love with the shape of you,

55
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,800
we push and pull like a magnet do.

56
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,100
Although my heart is falling too, I'm in

00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,320
love with your body.

58
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,900
Last night you were in my room, now

59
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,560
I bet she'd smell like you.

60
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,400

61
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,280

Come on, be my

70
00:02:51,540 --> 00:03:02,020
baby,

71
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,320
come on.
