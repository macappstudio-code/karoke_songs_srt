2
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,270
let's get out of this town Drive out

3
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,590
of the city, away from the crowds I

4
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,310
thought heaven can't help me now Nothing lasts

5
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:28,110
forever But this is gonna take me down

6
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,750
He's so tall and handsome as hell He's

7
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,510
so bad, but he does it so well

8
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,890
I can see the end as it begins

9
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:43,670
My one condition is Say you'll remember me

10
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,750
Standing in a nice dress Staring at the

11
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:51,230
sunset, babe Red lips and nosy cheeks Say

12
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,990
you'll see me again Even if it's just

13
00:00:53,990 --> 00:01:09,710
in your wildest dreams I

14
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,020
said, no one has to know what we

15
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,680
do His hands are in my hair, his

16
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,640
clothes are in my room And his voice

17
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,380
is a familiar sound Nothing lasts forever But

18
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,680
this is getting good now He's so tall

19
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,180
and handsome as hell He's so bad, but

20
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,920
he does it so well And when we've

21
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,680
had our very last kiss My last request

22
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,320
is Say you'll remember me Standing in a

23
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,000
nice dress Staring at the sunset, babe Red

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,180
lips and nosy cheeks Say you'll see me

25
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:55,180
again Even if it's just in your wildest

26
00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:07,300
dreams Wildest dreams You'll

27
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,900
see me in hindsight Hang about with you

28
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:14,840
all night, but it's a doubt Someday when

29
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,020
you leave me I bet these memories will

30
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:22,400
do you well You'll see me in hindsight

31
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,720
Tangled up with you all night, but it's

32
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,940
a doubt Someday when you leave me I

33
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,120
bet these memories will do you well You'll

34
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,480
see me in hindsight Hang about with you

35
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,080
all night, but it's a doubt Say you'll

36
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,920
remember me Standing in a nice dress Staring

37
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,500
at the sunset, babe Red lips and nosy

38
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,980
cheeks Say you'll see me again Even if

39
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:56,540
it's just pretend Say you'll remember me Standing

40
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,220
in a nice dress Staring at the sunset,

41
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,480
babe Red lips and nosy cheeks Say you'll

42
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,440
see me again Even if it's just in

43
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:15,880
your wildest dreams Wildest

44
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:22,560
