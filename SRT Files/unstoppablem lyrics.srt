1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
All smiles, I know what it takes to fool this town
I'll do it 'til the sun goes down
And all through the nighttime
Oh, yeah

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Oh, yeah, I'll tell you what you wanna hear
Leave my sunglasses on while I shed a tear
It's never the right time
Yeah, yeah

Yeah, I win every single game
I'm so powerful
I don't need batteries to play

Yeah, I'm unstoppable today
Unstoppable today
Unstoppable today

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Break down, only alone I will cry out loud
You'll never see what's hiding out
Hiding out deep down
Yeah, yeah

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I know, I've heard that to let your feelings show
Is the only way to make friendships grow
But I'm too afraid now
Yeah, yeah

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I put my armor on, show you how strong I am
I put my armor on, I'll show you that I am
