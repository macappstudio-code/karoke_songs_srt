00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hey, hey
Bye bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye

2
00:00:04,001 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm doing this tonight
You're probably gonna start a fight
I know this can't be right
Hey baby come on

3
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:20,000
I loved you endlessly
When you weren't there for me
So now it's time to leave and make it alone

4
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:26,000
I know that I can't take no more
It ain't no lie
I want to see you out that door
Baby bye bye bye

5
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:33,000
Don't want to be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
You may hate me but it ain't no lie
Baby bye bye bye

6
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:40,000
Bye bye
Don't really want to make it tough
I just want to tell you that I've had enough
It might sound crazy but it ain't no lie
Baby bye bye bye

7
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:46,000
You just hit me with the truth
Now girl you're more than welcome to
So give me one good reason
Baby come on

8
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:54,000
I've lived for you and me
And now I really come to see
That life would be much better once you're gone

9
00:00:54,001 --> 00:01:00,000
I know that I can't take no more
It ain't no lie
I want to see you out that door
Baby bye bye bye

10
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:07,000
Don't want to be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
You may hate me but it ain't no lie
Baby bye bye bye

11
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:15,000
Bye bye
Don't really want to make it tough
I just want to tell you that I've had enough
Might sound crazy but it ain't no lie
Baby bye bye bye

12
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm giving up I know for sure
I don't' want to be the reason for your love no more
Bye bye

13
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm checking out, I'm signing off
I don't want to be the loser, and I've had enough
I don't want to be your fool in this game for two
So I'm leaving you behind

14
00:01:28,001 --> 00:01:33,000
(Bye bye bye)
I don't want to make it tough
(Make it tough)
But I've had enough
And it ain't no lie

15
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:40,000
Don't want to be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
I don't want to be your fool
But it ain't no lie
Baby bye bye bye

16
00:01:40,001 --> 00:01:47,000
Bye bye
Don't really want to make it tough
I just want to tell you that I've had enough
It might sound crazy but it ain't no lie
Bye bye
