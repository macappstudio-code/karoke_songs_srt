00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
See upcoming pop shows
Get tickets for your favorite artists
My smile is beamin' (Yeah), my skin is gleamin' (Is gleamin')
The way it shine, I know you've seen it (You've seen it)

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I bought a crib just for (Just for) the closet (Closet)
Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Baby)

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You like my hair? Gee, thanks,
